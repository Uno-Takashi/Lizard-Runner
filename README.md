This project is wrapped to use [lizard](http://www.lizard.ws/) as a Github Action.

- **Rapid Container**
  - The lizard-runner employs a lightweight container to achieve build times that are competitive with the combination of actions/setup-python and pip. In most cases, preparation to begin analysis takes less than 30 seconds.
- **Easy-to-use variable specification**
  - Wrapping command line arguments allows for more intuitive execution.
- **CI mode is equipped**
  - In CI mode, the job will fail if a warning is issued. This feature prevents overly complex code from being merged.
